## ODR Live Timing 

### Website 
 
This repository hosts the website for the ODR live timing site. Every time a new commit is pushed, the /public/ site will redeploy via github actions to the live firebase site. livetiming.html is the file which contains timing info. 

### Worker Service

This application runs as a background service on a windows machine. This can be used on the timing computer to connect to the git repo, move the new timing file in, stage, commit, and push changes to git. GitHub will detect these changes and move them onto the firebase server.
